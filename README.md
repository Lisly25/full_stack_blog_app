# Full stack blog app

This website is first and foremost the result of working on through the exercises of University of Helsinki's [full stack open course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/). More specifically, the exercises from part 7. I did add some extra features on top of that, however.

This website has been deployed on Render, and can be visited [here](https://full-stack-blog-app-uclw.onrender.com/).

## The tech stack

The frontend is written in modern JavaScript and uses **React**. Additionally, I also used **React Query**/**TanStack Query** to store and manage data retrieved from the server.

The design of the website is admittedly quite simple, but it is fully responsive. I have used **Material UI** for styling.

The backend is also written in JavaScript (**NodeJS** with **express**). **MongoDB** was used as a database. Note, that I mostly used the base provided by the course for the backend - I do also have my own version of it that can be found [here](https://github.com/Lisly25/full_stack_open/tree/main/part4).

Currently, the only feature I added beyond the course requirements is a registration page.
